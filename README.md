I am a researcher and developer working on Artificial Intelligence applications in education, science, and automation. My research includes generative AI for learning, with a publication at COBENGE 2025, and scientific software for composite material analysis, published at CILAMCE 2024 and MeComPE. I also participate in Kaggle competitions, winning the “Concrete Strength – Regression” challenge and gaining experience in NLP, computer vision, and tabular data. On GitHub, I share projects like VIBE (YouTube to blog posts) and SAGE (LLM-based paper summarization).
