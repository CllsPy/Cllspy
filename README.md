In my research, I focus on the core challenges of Large Language Models (LLMs). I am an expert in improving model performance and reliability, using techniques like quantization to enhance scalability and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to reduce hallucinations. My work in fine-tuning, including with LoRA, enables me to quickly optimize models, ensuring they are efficient, accurate, and ready for production environments.
